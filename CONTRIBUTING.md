## Contributors' Guide

First off, thanks for considering a contribution to this living open source book!  It's only through the contributions of many different people that we will be able to keep the book technically accurate and up to date.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the contributors who are managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issues, assessing proposed changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

This book is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from contributing new sections or even complete chapters, to submitting reports on typos or writing errors, to everything in between!

Note: This book may be licensed for publication by a commercial publisher in the future.  In such a case the open source version will remain openly available under the same (CC-BY-NC) license.  See below for more information on acknowledgment of contributions.

### Ground Rules

We have a few ground rules for contributing:

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to propose. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback before submitting a pull request.
* Any new text submitted for the book should be authored by a human.  You may use AI tools to check or improve the text, but please draft it in your own voice.

If you include new code in your submission:

* Any code submitted within the text should follow the Python style guide (PEP8).
* Please avoid introducing new dependencies whenever possible.

### Your First Contribution

Are you unsure where to being contributing to the book?  You can start by reading through the chapters and noting any typos, misspellings, or awkward wordings.  

You can also look through the open issues and find any issues that you have the knowledge to address.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

### Recognizing contributors

Individuals who make line-level contributions (such as fixing typos) will be listed in the acknowledgements of the text.  

Contributors who create significant new sections or chapters may be listed as coauthors.  Individuals who wish to be listed as a coauthor should discuss this with the maintainer prior to contributing, to avoid any misunderstandings. 

The main author (Russell Poldrack) will remain the sole holder of the copyright of this text and may relicense the text for commercial reuse.
